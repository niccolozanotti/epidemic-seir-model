# Simulation


## World generation

To generate the world we adapted the concepts of the [SMOOTH paper][1] of Clusters, and Groups to be used 
in an epidemic simulation.  

We decided to divide the world in Clusters, represented by rectangles, so that we have division from a cluster
to the others. Every cluster has in fact his number of Groups and his number of people that reside here.
We choose to use rectangles because it's very easy to divide it in various separate parts, and it's easy
to stop people from interacting with closed clusters.

Initially we generate the world by dividing it in various rectangle, to which we randomly distributes people
and locations. We then generate every cluster.  
For every cluster we start by generating people and their home (some people will share the same home).
We then determine the number of Groups based on the number of locations in the clusters, and we distribute group centers
over the Rectangle Area. We determine the number of location in every group, and then we generate them.  
For every Group we generate the locations around their center, so that every location is at least
$`\frac{TRANSMISSION\_RANGE}{10}`$ close to another.

## People mobility

As stated in section _III B_ of the [paper][1], the only allowed mobility model for the people in the simulation
corresponds to [Random waypoint model][2]: a model consisting of a random movement toward a target(_i.e._ a waypoint
on the map). \
In the implementation, each `Mobility_model` object owns both a `Person` and `std::vector<Location*> Path`, where
the latter is a container with (pointers to) all person's next possible targets. \
The responsible methods for determining person available-to-visit waypoints on the map are `World::generate_path()`
and `Cluster::generate_cluster_path()`, respectively filling `std::vector<Location*> Path` with locations from Green 
Clusters and with locations from a specific cluster.

### Least-Action Trip Planning
The way a node of the network(_i.e_ a person) chooses a target waypoint on the map is governed by the **Least-Action 
Trip Planning** algorithm, a simple model, trying to mock real human behaviour, consisting of the following: 

1. distance from current person location to all available new targets is computed
   
2. a weight function based on a parameter(in our implementation `LATP alpha`), then, determines the probability for 
each target to be visited 
   
3. the next target waypoint choice is finally made using the just calculated probabilities as weights

In our simulation, LATP algorithm is implemented by `Mobility_model::next_location()` method, determining next person
target using person's current `LATP alpha` parameter the person's cluster. \
A detailed description of LATP algorithm can be found in section _III C_ of [this][3] paper.

### Pause times

When gotten to a target location, a `stay`, measured in simulation steps, for the person is generated. Pause times are distributed according to 
a truncated power-law 
The reason for that is, once again, to try mocking human behaviour: one person will pause for a relatively small amount
of time at the majority of waypoints and for a larger number of steps at fewer waypoints. \
Looking at SMOOTH paper authors' own implementation, we decided to make pause times follow their same distribution,
because of the proven statistical validity of their results:
```math
   t = {\Bigg[  \frac{(1 - u) {{p}_{MAX}}^{\beta} + {{p}_{MIN}}^{\beta} }{{{p}_{MAX}{p}_{MIN}}^{\beta}} \Bigg]}^{\frac{1}{\beta}}   
```
```math
   u \in [0,1)
```
where $`u`$ is uniformly distributed and the values of $`p_{MIN},p_{MAX}`$, and the LÃ¨vy exponent($`\beta`$) are fixed parameters of the simulation found in [parameters.hpp](simulation/parameters.hpp) file.

## Classes

### Position
Position is the class that handle the coordinate of the simulated world. It is composed of 2 double private
members which represent respectively the `x` and the `y` coordinates, and by function to check if two position
are close and to move a position closer to another

* `next_location()` which follows the Least Action Trip Planning algorithm(LATP) to select the next
  location to visit from the **path** vector.

rectangles as it is a very simple shape to handle. It is composed of 2 private members:
1. `blh_corner` the bottom left-hand corner of the rectangle
2. `trh_corner` the top right-hand corner of the rectangle

It is then composed of various function, the most important are:
* `Split()` which split a rectangle in 2 rectangles of different sizes.
* `Divide(int n)` which divide the rectangle in n rectangles using the Split function.

### Group
The Group class represent a group of Location object that are generated close to each other; it is composed
of three private members:
1. `Locations` a vector of Location object.
2. `center` the coordinate of the centre around which the Locations are generated.
3. `grp_engine` an object of the Random class, used to generate random numbers.

### Zone
It's an enum class that represent the color of the cluster, which is dependant on the number of infected;
there are 3 possible values, which have different restrictions:
1. `Green` people can go to every other green cluster, big number of location to visit per person.
2. `Yellow` people can stay only in their cluster, smaller number of location to visit per person.
3. `Red` people ca stay only in their cluster, very small number of location to visit per person.

### Cluster

  locations selected from the clusters, based on the weights vector.
### Simulation
The Simulation class handle the evolution of the epidemic, it is composed of 7 private members:
1. `sim_engine` an object of the Random class, used to generate random numbers.
2. `wrld` an object of the World class, it represent the world where the epidemic is simulated.
3. `alpha` represent the probability that a person pass from Exosed to Infected status.
4. `beta` represent the probability that a person pass from Susceptible to Exposed status when in contact
   with an Infected person
5. `gamma` represent the probability that a person pass from the Infected to Recovered status
6. `spread_radius` it's the radius that represent when a person is in contact with another
7. `time` represent the duration of the simulation NEED TO PROBABLY REMOVE

It is then composed of various function, the most important are:
* `move()` move all the person in the wrld object.
* `spread()` spread the epidemic.
* `update_zone()` update the color of every cluster based on the number of Infected.

The simulation is divided in cycles, which is composed of 10(TO BE POSSIBLY CHANGED) step:  
Every step consist in calling the `move()`, the `spread()` and the `update_status()` functions.  
Every cycle consist in calling 10 steps and the calling the `update_zone()` function to, if necessary,
change the cluster color.

#### move() function
The move function is an adaptation of the random waypoint mobility model seen in the SMOOTH paper.  
It checks every cluster and, based on the zone color, it calls the correspondent move function from:
* `move_white(Cluster&)`
* `move_yellow(Cluster&)`
* `move_red(Cluster&)`

The cluster color decide the number of location to visit and from which cluster they will be chosen.
If the cluster is *Green* then about half of the location will be chosen from the person's cluster, while the
other half from other green cluster; if the cluster is *Red* or *Yellow* then they will all be chosen from
the person's cluster.

Every move function checks every people in the cluster:
* If they are home it checks if they leave it based on `home_probability`, and if they do it fill the path
  vector, following the rules decided by the cluster color
* If they are not at home:
    + If it has arrived at target location:
        - If `stay` is higher than 0 than it remain at the target location
        - if `stay` is 0 then it selects a new target location from the path with `mobility_model::next_location()`
    + If it has not arrived at the target location it moves closer to it with `mobility_model::move()`

When the path is empty it returns home.

#### spread() function
The spread function check every *Exposed* and *Infected* person in the world.
* For every *Exposed* person it check if it becomes *Infected* using `alpha` probability.
* For every *Infected* person:
    * It checks the color of the cluster in which the person reside
        * If it is *Green* it checks all person to see which are *Susceptible*, inside the spread radius and not
          at home, to see if they become *Exposed* using `beta` probability.
        * If it is *Yellow* or *Red* it only checks all person in the same cluster of the person.
    * It checks if it becomes *Recovered*  using `gamma` probabilty.

| --------- | -------------------------------------- |
| ![green](https://via.placeholder.com/25/0ADC00/000000?text=+)  | When *Cluster::zone* is `Zone::Green`  |
| ![yellow](https://via.placeholder.com/25/EBF216/000000?text=+) | When *Cluster::zone* is `Zone::Yellow` |
| ![red](https://via.placeholder.com/25/F04646/000000?text=+)    | When *Cluster::zone* is `Zone::Red`    |

People and graphs:

| Color     | meaning                                |

At the left we have the simulation. At the right the graphs of the 4 statuses of the people.  
The colored rectangles represent the various clusters, the Blue points represent group of locations, and the colored small squares represent the people that
are moving, all the people that are in their home are not displayed.

### Random
This class implements the random generation features critical for this project. It  making use of the header-only library
`randutil`. This small library enhances c++11 random-number facilities found in <random> supplying a simple and easy to use
class. The main purpose of our use of it in our random implementation is the high quality seeding given by the use of multiple
sources of entropy(see [here][seed_entropy]) which sometimes may not be achieved through `std::random_device`.

[randutil][randutils_git]
which guarantees high entropy seeding which sometimes may not be
achieved through std::random_device. Additionally it implements some random operations useful for our Simulation.
