# Epidemic simulation
This project represents the solution which we, Niccol√≤ Zanotti and Filippo Pretolani, two Physics Undegraduates studying at
University of Bologna, gave to our University Programming Course [final assignment][assignment].
<!-- put relative path to extern -->
We collaborated on writing the source code found in this repository except for, of course, external libraries [code](##Building)

The project is made up of 2 main parts:

1. Using the known SEIR model to determine the spread of an epidemic, given initial conditions and
   parameters

2. Simulating an epidemic

We solved the SEIR ordinary differential equations using both a first-order numerical method([Euler][euler] method) and
with a local error of

```math
\frac{dS}{dt} = -\beta \frac{S}{N} I \\[4mm]
\frac{dE}{dt} = \beta \frac{S}{N} I - \alpha E \\[4mm]
\frac{dI}{dt} = \alpha E - \gamma I \\[4mm]
\frac{dR}{dt} = \gamma I
```


a fourth-order one ([Runge-Kutta][rk4] method).
The point was t

The Simulation of epidemic is based on the SMOOTH* model to simulate how people moves
and implements a division in Clusters which can change color, changing how people move.

## Dependencies
- [Lyra][lyra] (submodule)
- [Doctest][doct] (submodule)
- [SFML](http://www.sfml-dev.org/) (required)
- [Root](https://root.cern) (required)
- [CMake](https://cmake.org/) (required)

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
## Building
Make sure all the required dependencies are installed on your machine and fully working.

SISTEMA

First of all, clone the repository :
```shell
#clone the released branch of the repository
git clone -b main --single-branch https://gitlab.com/Feyn-23/epidemic.git 
#enter the repository
cd epidemic
```
To facilitate the user, building scripts are available inside `scripts` project subdirectory.

Then you can either run the script in the script folder:
```shell
#from the cloned repository directory
cd scripts
#run the script
./quick-build.sh
```
or you can build directly:
```shell
#create and enter a build directory
mkdir build && cd build
#prepare to build files in release mode
cmake .. -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release
#if you want to build every app
make
#if you want to build a specific app
make appname
```
Instead of building files using a single core, one can take advantage of the other available cores on the machine to
speed up the building process. To do that, it's sufficient to add `-jN` option at build time, N being equal to the number
of available machine cores plus 1: 

```shell
# for a quad-core machine
make sim-graphics -j 4
```

The available executable applications(CMake targets) are the following:

| App name     | Purpose                                                       |
| ------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------  |
| seir         | Solve the SEIR differential equation using a numerical method |
| sim          | Simulate an epidemic, without graphical output                |
| sim-graphics | Simulate an pandemic, with graphical output                   |

### Notes
On certain devices, CMake might not be able to detect ROOT installation. If that is the case, the problem can be solved by manually specifying the
path to your ROOT installation ,setting the CMake Variable ROOT_DIR at build time:
```shell
cmake -B path-to-build-dir -S path-to-source -DROOT_DIR="path-to-ROOT-installation"
```
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
## User Input
The applications built by this project collect user input through command line arguments. 
We chose the command line parser libray [Lyra][lyra] to handle this task.
The value of an input variable can be setted at execution time by referring to one of its names, that is,
a `char` following a short dash(`-`) or a `string` following a long dash(`--`). \
Therefore, the command to pass the value of two generic input variables named respectively `--var1` and `-v`
is the following:
```shell
./appname -var1 value_of_var1 -v value_of_v
#or
./appname -v value_of_v -var1 value_of_var1 
```
showing also the fact that order is not critical for correct parsing.

Clearly, each application has its own input variables. 
The following tables show the available input options
for each application(an empty cell means the variable doesn't have a second name):

Of course the user has not to pass all these variables to run the program; there are optionals which can be
default chosen, and some which have to be specified. 
The following examples show all the possible combinations of input variables, choosing,when available, the longer name and omitting
variables values just for the sake of clarity:
```shell
#seir 
exec 
exec --method --people --alpha --beta --gamma --time
exec --method -- 
```
The standard parameters used to perform the simulation 

Lyra offers a help interface consisting of a summary of all input variables with relative names and descriptions
which can be accessed simply by specifying `-h` or `--help` at execution time.



```shell
./appname --def 1
#or
./appname --default 1
```
is equivalent to execute the following command
```shell
./appname 
```

### Input validation
All arguments 

## Running
All the built apps will be in the epidemic/apps directory.

If you are on WSL make sure the Xserver is running as it is required for every application

TO ADD ALL THE PARTS RELATED TO INPUT

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Tests
The testing strategy adopted for this project was _Unit testing_. To this aim, we made use of the header library
[doctest][doct]. \
Testing is enabled in Debug mode in cmake; so if you want to run a test you just need to build and run it,
either using the script:
```shell
#from the epidemic directory, enter the script directory
cd scripts
#and run the script
./testing.sh
#you can then go to the test_build directory and run the test
cd ../test_build && ./testname
```
Or manually
```shell
#from the epidemic directory create and enter a build directory
mkdir build && cd build
#prepare to build file in debug mode
cmake .. -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Debug
```shell
#build the test
make testname
#run the test
cd tests && ./testname
#or
./tests/testname
```
The tests are(TO FILL):

| App name     | function    |
| ------------ | ----------- |
| test1         | Test if `S + I + E + R` remain costant when solving the SEIR system |
| test2         | Test if both `Simulation::clean_path` and `Simulation::clean_cluster_path` works correctly  |
| test3         | Check if the generation of a Simulation object works correctly |
